### About
- This is a toy personal website, which is implemented via HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
- This is an assignment of [2025 WaffleStudio Frontend Seminar](https://github.com/wafflestudio/seminar-2025).
- It is inspired by [melangue/dactl](https://github.com/melangue/dactl) theme.

### Getting Started
- Run the development server. For example, you can use Python:
  ```sh
    Œª python3 -m http.server 3000
  ```
- Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (the port number may differ) with your browser to see the result.
- You can start editing the page by modifying `index.html`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Deploy on Vercel
- Also, you can see the website [here](https://young-home.vercel.app).
